# dictcompare
Repo for my "DictCompare" scenario (Python).

The scenario reads text files in a specific format (word pairs separated by ":", each at a new line) and creates dictionaries from them. The filenames (or paths, if the files are not in the folder with the scenario) need to be specified as arguments at execution of the scenario.

After that, the scenario compares the files and shows the difference: the word pairs that are different.
